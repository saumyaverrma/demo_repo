# 🌍AirGuard  
**Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring & Alert System**
Even in the same city, people experience different pollution exposure. Someone who spends more time outdoors breathes far more polluted air than someone mostly indoors. <br>
**AirGuard tracks every outdoor session using geofencing and combines duration × live AQI to calculate each user’s personal exposure score.**<br>
This app helps users understand how much polluted air they personally breathe every day using live AQI data and geofencing.  
At the end of the day, the app also generates a personalized recovery plan (breathing + diet suggestions) using the Gemini API.

## 🧩Features

### **1. Real-Time AQI Tracking**
- Fetches live AQI from OpenAQ API  
- Shows current AQI and PM2.5 around the user  



### **2. Outdoor Exposure Timer**
- User sets home location  
- Geofence detects when user leaves/enters home  

```
Exposure = Time Outside × AQI
```



### **3. Daily Exposure Summary**
Displays:  
1. Today’s time outdoors  
2. Average AQI  
3. Total exposure score  



### **4. Auto generated recovery plan**
 1. Score 0–100 → Low (Simple breathing exercises (2–3 guided breathing rounds))<br>
 2. Score 101–250 → Moderate (Recovery: Hydration + light movement (1 hydration action + 2 light movements / stretches))<br>
 3. Score 251–400 → High (Mask + avoid exposure + diet + breathing (mask reminder, 2 dietary tips, 1 breathing + light indoor activity))<br>
 4. Score 400 → Critical (Doctor recommendation + immediate actions (call-to-action, emergency tips, reduce exposure now))<br>

## 📱How the app works? 
(refer the video for detailed explaination)
1. Click on the set home buttton.
2. Walk about 15 m away from the location in order to get outside the preset home location
3. Session starts as you get out of the preset home location
4. Once you get back to the home location it will show the total exposure (which is equal to the time outside * AQI of the location.
5. Scroll down to see the recovery option click on it.
6. It shows the solutions to follow according to the level of exposure.
7. Click on the task to start your recovery sesssion.
8. Complete them.
9. YEAH!! you have countered your AQI exposure.
